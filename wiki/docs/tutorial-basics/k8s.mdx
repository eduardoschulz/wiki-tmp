# Understanding the Pod Lifecycle

In Kubernetes, Pods are ephemeral. They are created, assigned a unique ID (UID), and scheduled to nodes where they remain until termination or deletion.

## Pod Phases

A Pod's `status` object contains a `phase` field. Here is a breakdown of what each state means:

| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pending** | The Pod has been accepted by the cluster, but one or more containers are not yet running. |
| **Running** | The Pod has been bound to a node, and all containers have been created. |
| **Succeeded** | All containers in the Pod have terminated successfully (exit code 0). |
| **Failed** | All containers have terminated, and at least one container terminated in failure. |

## Interactive Example: Checking Status

You can check the current phase of your pods using `kubectl`. Try running the command below in your local environment:

<Terminal command="kubectl get pods -n default" />

### Current Deployment Health
<StatusBadge phase="Running" message="All systems nominal" />

## Probes: The Heartbeat of a Pod

To ensure your application is actually healthy (and not just "running"), Kubernetes uses Probes.

### 1. Liveness Probe
Used to know when to restart a container. For example, if your app hangs.

### 2. Readiness Probe
Used to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 3
